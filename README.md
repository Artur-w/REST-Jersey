# REST Jersey

## Restful application
### CS402 Parallel and Distributed Systems
### Assignemnt

Application uses endpoints to provide service:
Kilometers and Miles converter using GET Request with Path parameter.
WarehouseService enable to store new orders and retrive a list of stored orders.

Both have own clients and can return various media type, including JSON.

There is also HelloWorld file and SimpleClient that demonstrates simple
JSON String response.

Additionaly I'm adding Postman schema for easier testing.
